## Advent of Code 2024

Yay! I'm trying it out again this year! Maybe I'll see it through to the end this time?

I compiled a list of languages I feel relatively comfortable with (which doesn't necessarily mean I've mastered or done much substantial work with them) and randomly draw one each day, needing to stick with it to solve that day's problem.

Here are the problems I've solved, the language with which I solved them, and the command used to run the script.

- Day 1: JavaScript `node day01.js`
- Day 2: Zig `zig run day02.zig`
- Day 3: C# `dotnet script day03.cs`
- Day 4: GDScript `godot4 --headless -s day04.gd`
- Day 5: Rust `cargo +nightly -Zscript day05.rs`
- Day 6: Java `java day06.java`
- Day 7: Lua `lua day07.lua`
- Day 8: Python `python3 day08.py`
- Day 9: C `gcc day09.c -O1 -std=c99 -Wall && ./a.out`
- Day 10: FreeBASIC `fbc day10.bas && ./day10`
